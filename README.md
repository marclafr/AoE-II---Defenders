## Digital Wolves Games presents...

Tower Defender:

Introduction:

Age Of Empires 2: Defenders is a game for the Project 2 subject on the Design and Development of Videogames degree
at Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia (CITM), Terrassa. Our aim will be to create a Tower Defense with some mechanics,
units, buildings and art from Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, developed by Ensemble Studios.

About final Game:

You are the comander of a small village and you will need to defend to the diferents civilizations.
You will need to survive the maximum number of waves to repel the atack. Each wave will encrease the difficulty of the enemies waves.
You can build towers and training camps to protect the village. You can put the towers on the green areas. Also we can upgrade with the resouces
and do more efective the stadistics of towers.
The player will win once the time counter is over (20 minutes) and will lose if the enemy destroys the townhall.

Resouces: 

You will get an area to collect resouces. It serves to upgrade and build the towers and each upgrades. You can upgrade the resouces to collect faster.
But you will need to do a good managment with resouces.


Controls:

The game controles are based in a mouse and keyboard. While the keyboard can be used for “hot-keys” the mouse is used for most of the game’s control:
 - left click: select units or buildings and interact with ui (mainlly click buttons)
 - left click and drag: grup selection of units and multi wall consturction.
 - right click: is used to move selected units, chose targets and to change spawn destination of buildings that produce units.
 - space: camera move to townhall.
 
You can click on townhall to create buildings or train diferent units.
Also you can select the university to research about elementary towers and faster recolection of resouces. Once you have the elementary investigation, you
can select our tower and upgrade with the button located down to the left. 

Short-cuts
 
 - With number "1": You will build a basic wood tower.
 - With number "2": You will build a basic bombard tower.
 - With number "3": You will build a basic wall. You can drag with walls to create more than one wall at the same time.

Towers:

You will have 2 types of towers at the beginning of the game. Basic wood tower and basic bombard tower. On library you can investigate for upgrade our 
tower to different types of elementary towers.

 - Wood Tower: Got normal damage, normal hp, normal range and rate of fire.
 - Bombard Tower: Got a lot of damge, a lot of hp, less range than wood tower and heavy rate of fire.
Elementary types of towers:

 - Fire Tower: More damage than a wood tower, more health but less range.
