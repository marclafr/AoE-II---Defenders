Age of Empires: Defenders:

Introduction:

Age Of Empires 2: Defenders is a game for the Project 2 subject on the Design and Development of Videogames degree
at Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia (CITM), Terrassa. Our aim will be to create a Tower Defense with some mechanics, units, buildings and art from Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, developed by Ensemble Studios.


Controls:

Game controls are based in a mouse and keyboard. While the keyboard can be used for “hot-keys” the mouse is used for most of the game control:

- Mouse:
 	- left click: interact with ui (mainlly click buttons). 		Create soldiers and towers using the UI aswell.
 	- left click and drag: select units or buildings. 			Preference in units. 
	- right click: is used to move selected units and chose 		targets.

Shortcuts
- Keyboard:
	- 1: To create simple tower.
	- 2: To create bombard tower.
	- 3: To create wood wall.
	
	- K: Kill selected units (allies only).

	- Space Bar: Center camera on town hall.
	- ESC: To go to menu.

About final Game:

You are the comander of a small village and you will need to defend to the diferents civilizations.
You will need to survive the maximum number of waves to repel the atack. Each wave will increase the difficulty of the enemies waves.
You can build towers and training camps to protect the village. You can put the towers on the green areas. Also we can upgrade with the resources and do more effective the stadistics of towers.
The player will win once the time counter is over (30 minutes) and will lose if the enemy destroys the wall to the city.

Resources: 

You will get an area to collect resouces. It serves to upgrade and build the towers and each upgrades. You can upgrade the resouces to collect faster.
But you will need to do a good managment with resouces.

You will have 2 types of towers at the beginning of the game. Simple tower and  bombard tower. On library you can investigate for upgrade our 
tower to different types of elementary towers.
